          <h2>INTRODUCTION TO FIP</h2>

          <p>
            The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) is India's largest and most
            representative professional welfare body for pilots, established in
            1996. It represents over 5,500 Indian pilots from Scheduled
            Airlines, Non-Scheduled and General Aviation Operators, Helicopter
            Operations, and Ex-Defence Aviators. FIP is a non-profit,
            welfare-oriented professional body and not a trade union,
            functioning solely in the interest of aviation safety, professional
            standards, and the collective well-being of Indian pilots.
          </p>

          <p>
            From its inception, FIP has stood firmly for one non-negotiable
            principle SAFETY alongside the professional dignity, welfare, and
            rights of pilots. For nearly three decades, FIP has engaged
            constructively with the DGCA, Ministry of Civil Aviation, and other
            government authorities to ensure that aviation policies are shaped
            by scientific evidence, global best practices, and real-world
            operational realities, rather than short-term commercial
            considerations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recognising that safety begins with knowledge, competence, and
            disciplined training, FIP established its education wing, the
            Institute of Aviation & Aviation Safety (IAAS). IAAS delivers
            structured, regulator-aligned training in pilot ground subjects,
            aviation safety, and allied disciplines, with strong alignment to
            DGCA and ICAO standards. Through IAAS, FIP actively contributes to
            building a safety-driven, professionally competent, and future-ready
            aviation ecosystem for India.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since 2018, FIP has led sustained legal and regulatory interventions
            on Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) and fatigue-related safety
            issues, playing a pivotal role in protecting pilots from unsafe and
            fatigue-inducing practices. Following the 12 June 2025 Boeing-787
            accident, FIP emerged as a credible national voice, contributing
            decisively to the implementation of the Revised FDTL CAR and firmly
            opposing any dilution of established safety norms.

        <p>
          Beyond advocacy and education, FIP has demonstrated consistent
          commitment to pilot welfare through Loss of Licence (LOL) and Group
          Medical Cover (GMC) insurance schemes for over 16 years. These
          policies are highly competitive, with no LOL claim ever rejected to
          date and total claims exceeding ₹311 crore successfully settled. GMC
          claims have also been settled efficiently, providing pilots and their
          families with essential financial security.
        </p>

        <p>
          FIP, through IAAS, is expanding its professional development
          initiatives with programmes such as Pilot Ground Training (CPL/ATPL),
          Cabin Crew Training, Customer Service Training, Diploma courses in
          Hospitality, and Auditor programmes. FIP members are eligible for
          discounted training rates for their family members, with a focus on
          quality training and realistic placement opportunities across the
          aviation and hospitality sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The primary objective of FIP remains unwavering: to pursue aviation
          safety issues with all relevant government agencies, actively engage
          in accident-related safety deliberations, and uphold the highest
          professional standards. For the Federation of Indian Pilots, safety is
          non-negotiable, fatigue is real, and compromise is unacceptable in
          aviation.
